# Spotify-playlist-app

- This app lets a verified user search for songs in spotify's database and save them to a custom playlist which can be, then, directly saved to the user's spotify account
- Used Spotify's API and Implicit Grant Flow access token method
- Key learnings include State and props in React along with exposure to using third-party (Spotify) APIs and directly using them in the react-app without the need for a backend
# Future ideas for updates/fixes:
- Adding caching to save user's account information so that you don't have to log in every time the page is refreshed
- Using Context API or another state management method to avoid props drilling from parent components
